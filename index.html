                <h1>Backstory</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Design is more than knowing that green text and a red background is a terrible idea. It's concepts, sketching, planning, hundreds of revisions and multiple coffee breaks to fuel the madness that is flowing out of your mind and onto the screen.<hr class='linebreak'>
                A kinda long time ago, in the not-so-distant northwest that is Washington state, I started using Photoshop to ink illustrations. Fast forward to now, and I have extensive experience with not only Photoshop, but with Adobe CC, AfterEffects, Premiere Pro, HTML5, CSS3, Jquery, and I make a mean kitchen sink too.<hr class='linebreak'>
                I am a big fan of motion graphics, as well as UX/UI design. It's still a shiny new field in design that is being filled, and most companies that have dipped their toes into the proverbial soup that is this new school of thought have come out changed for the better. I am versed in the language of interaction design and have experience designing practical examples for a multinational company.</p>

            <h2><strong>"Sakura"</strong> Bistro Website</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I love Japan. The culture, the customs, the art, and most certainly the food. So when I started learning about UX/UI design, I decided to re-visit an old idea I had in college for a sushi restaurant website. I was very happy with the end results and even managed to get not only props from my former design co-workers but also the front and back end programmers as well.</p>

            <hr>
            <p>While thinking of projects I was reminded that you can shine your brightest in design when you are passionate about what it is you are making. To me, dogs are amazing and can bring you more happiness in their lifetime than many of your own relatives. I wanted to make sure than no dog went without a loving friend. This project is something I want to see come to life, and hopefully be adopted one day too.</p>
