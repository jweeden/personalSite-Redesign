      <p>Thanks so much for wandering into my site! No, wait! Don't go so soon, stay a while, and listen! Or take a look, more rather, at my design works.</p>
      <p>My name is Joseph Weeden, and I am a knight... Just kidding. I am a designer from Kennewick, WA, with my BA in 'Visual Communication Design'. I received training in general design, web design, typography, motion graphics, and had classes specializing in creating personas and getting inside the mind of your target audience/user. After my 4 years were up, and I had some client experience under my belt, I was most versed in motion design and user centered design, with an overall strong grasp on design as a whole.</p>
      <p>During college I had a job as a page designer and illustrator for the college's paper, 'The Easterner'. I was there for just over a year, working closely with other designers, photographers, and editors, making sure that the tight 3 day deadlines were met and the papers were released to our visual standard. It was a lot of fun, and a great introduction to designing in the real world. After graduation I had a brief hiatus from work, only to fly across the country to start working in Nashville, TN.</p>
      <p>I started work at Hospital Corporation of America in July, 2015 as a 'UX Design Intern'. I was originally brought on just for odds-and-ends work, but ended up working with another intern to basically take over transitioning almost all of HCA's hospital websites logos and colors from their old sites to the new standard that was being pushed out. I ended up transitioning over 400 sites in my time there, as well as created new ways to improve the process with the other intern. On top of just doing EB (transitions) and random in house work, I was also brought on to work on motion design, both for marketing purposes and interaction design.</p>
